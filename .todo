1. can client create a subproject? if subproject created automaticlly, 
then created_by should be created_by: 'system', but we need to add assigned_to: 'UUID' 
(specialist, which has be chosed when client was created booking)

2. does the booking need to know which project and subproject it specifically refers to?

3. how project is having information about his service types from booking? or system should create subprojects and then add they to project (-> project knows every type of subproject)?

Can a client create a subproject?
    No, the client cannot create subprojects directly. Subprojects are created automatically by the system or manually by employees (engineers/designers) when starting work on a project. In this case, created_by should be the UUID of the employee who creates the subproject, not "system". The assigned_to field is not needed, because created_by already indicates a specialist who works with the subproject.
Should a reservation know which project and subproject it belongs to?
    Yes, a reservation should know which project it belongs to (via project_id), but not necessarily to a specific subproject, because a reservation is the time allocated for a certain type of service, and subprojects are created already during the work on the project.
How does the project get information about the types of services from the booking?
    When a reservation is created, the system can automatically create a corresponding subproject with the same type of service (service_type) and add it to the project. Thus, the project will contain subprojects, each representing a specific type of service, and the project will know all types of services through its subprojects.
